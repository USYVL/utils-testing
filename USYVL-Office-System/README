  I am trying to collect all the pieces that a usyvl machine needs to have
  to be configured....

  # OSX setup
  3 Administrator Accounts, Administrator (admin), Aaron Martin (aaron), Randy (randy)
  1 Standard account: Game Days (gamedays)

  rsync-3.x
  apache webserver
  php build with pdflib and --enable-ftp at a minimum (php.ini may need to enable pdf module)
  ln -s /Library/Webserver/Documents /www

  # Website contents
  /www/usyvl/donate
  /www/usyvl/scheduling

  # a whole bunch of files are stored in the files heirarchy.  Those can be rsynced over 
  favicon.ico (in correct location)....

  # Rsync is very desirable
  # should set up a LaunchDaemon to rsync to the phplib stuff
  # could also use this to rsync the files heirarchy to the destination computer

  # Firewall setup
  /usr/local/sbin/firewallutil
  /etc/rc.local (modified)

  # from this dir
  scp -r ./files/Users/Shared/* stadm-g4:/Users/Shared
